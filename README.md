# Peter Geipel's Portfolio

## Description

This portfolio was created to allow new people to get to know Peter Geipel a little better.  Not only will they be able to see my technical abilities, but also get a sense of personality through my style and projects.  By showcasing myself here, I have a better opportunity to network while implementing the skills I have learned.
